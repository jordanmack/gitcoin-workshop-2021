# Hackathon Workshop 2021

This is the demonstration code for the "Nervos Broaden the Spectrum Part 2" Hackathon Workshop which was originally scheduled for presentation on September 12th, 2021.

- ethereum-simplest: This is the Ethereum example using the minimal Simple Storage contract.
- godwoken-simplest: This is the Godwoken example using the minimal Simple Storage contract.

This code examples are based off of the [ethereum-simple](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop/tree/ethereum-simple) and [godwoken-simple](https://github.com/Kuzirashi/blockchain-workshop/tree/godwoken-simple) examples, but simplified even further.
